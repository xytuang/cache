# What is Daedalus?
Daedalus is a simple in-memory cache. The cache stores data as key-value pairs, where the keys are interface types and the values can be of any type. The cache is designed to be concurrent-safe with the use of a sync.Mutex.

This library "daedalus" is a pure implementation and does not rely on any external dependencies. It is a self-contained implementation of an in-memory cache.
